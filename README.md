# Cromulent-Items

This is a Risk of Rain 2 Mod that adds a few items from a friend group into the game.

Current Items:
1. The Jacob Blast (Red Item): This item causes a scaling chance (rate of .5%) to activate a 'Tonic' Effect

2. Grug (Green Item): On Kill, make a 15 hp barrier if you do not have one. On hit with a barrier, chance to fire a missile that does ~30% of your total bar (health, shield) damage, scaling with number of items.
