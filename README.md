# Cromulent-Items

This is a Risk of Rain 2 Mod that adds a few items from a friend group into the game.

## Current Items:
1. The Jacob Blast (Red Item): This item causes a scaling chance (rate of .5%) to activate a 'Tonic' Effect

2. Grug (Green Item): On kill, if you have no barrier, gain one. If you have a barrier, on hit, 30% chance to fire a missile that does ~30% of your total bar (health, shield) damage. (Aegis makes this item broken)

3. Respect (White Item): Adds 5% (.05) to your proc coefficient
