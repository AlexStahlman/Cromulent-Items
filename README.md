# Cromulent-Items

This is a Risk of Rain 2 Mod that adds a few items from a friend group into the game.

Current Items:
1. The Jacob Blast (Red Item): This item causes a scaling chance (rate of .5%) to activate a 'Tonic' Effect

2. Grug (Green Item): Add 5% crit chance (+5% each pickup). On Crit, fire a missile that does ~30% of your total bar (health, shield) damage.



# Patch Notes

0.1.2 - Fixed an Error with the mod breaking when used with some mods
      - Fixed an issue where every crit spawned the missile regardless of having the item (Lol my bad)

0.1.1 - Grug Released

0.1.0 - Jacob Blast Released
